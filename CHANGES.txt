# Agilo for trac Changelog #
## This document should contain all the major changes made to the software :-) ##

## 0.9.12 / 1.3.12 Pro (2013-11-18) ##
 * Error reporting module now points to TracHacks
 * Fixed bug causing tickets to be deleted when deleting comments
 * Fixed problem with Windows installer permissions on Windows 7 (and newer)
 * Fixed zero division error in some situations where team capacity is not set
 * Fixed bug affecting ticket types with dashes in their name
 * Improved documentation

## 0.9.11 / 1.3.11 Pro (2013-08-29) ##
 * Showing the sprint's start and end dates on sprint backlog page
 * Ticket view and edit tabs unified
 * Fixed compatibility with batch modify
 * Fixed error when creating sprints for milestones with names including forward slashes

## 0.9.10 / 1.3.10 Pro (2013-05-23) ##
 * It is now possible to export and print the sprint whiteboard
 * Added datetime picker for sprint start/end dates
 * Searchable choosers: the sprint, milestone and owner choosers are now searchable. Just click them and start typing!
 * Fixed styling issue preventing sprint progress bars from being displayed correctly in roadmap view
 * Fixed bug in ticket edit view that caused editing conflicts
 * Fixed bug breaking inplace edit buttons for newly created backlog items

## 0.9.9 / 1.3.9 Pro (2012-11-29) ##
 * Added support for Trac 1.0
 * Added support for Solaris in Agilo for Trac PRO
 * Dropped support for Trac 0.11.x and Python 2.4.x
 * Fixed bug causing the filter logic to fail under specific conditions when updating a ticket in the backlog view. Thanks to SteveRC for the help.
 * Fixed bug causing emails to be sent even if nothing had really changed (backlog inline editing)
 * Fixed bug #1117 - Cannot set repository type when adding new repository in admin panel

## 0.9.8 / 1.3.8 Pro (2012-05-03) ##
 * Manage 'task' tickets via xml-rpc. Both read and write operations are now supported (including changing ticket status, attachments...), but currently the xml-rpc support is limited to tickets of type 'task'.  Extended support like different ticket types and hierarchical information is planned for next versions. For this feature to work the Trac XML-RPC plugin (http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin) has to be installed
 * Fixed bug causing calculated fields in the backlog view to be incorrect when involving tickets of a type not included in the backlog.
 * Fixed wrong admin link when the logged in user does not have admin rights
 * Fixed bug causing the ticket fields to be hidden when loading ticket edit pages
 * Fixed other small bugs
  
## 0.9.7 / 1.3.7 Pro (2012-03-07) ##
 * Story points burndown. The Agilo Dashboard now contains a new useful chart: the story points burndown. Start a new sprint and check it out!
 * (PRO) Multiple columns support. We have removed the constraint of only two columns in the Whiteboard. Configuration instructions here: https://dev.agile42.com/wiki/TracIni#agilo-whiteboard-section. For upgrading users that were already using the feature, the trac.ini file has to be updated as well
 * Added GUI to export CSV from backlog view
 * Fixed #1112 - Clicking on View button in left panel when there is no sprint shows internal error page
 * Fixed bug causing ticket links to be incorrect in backlog view on single environment setups
 
## 0.9.6.2 / 1.3.6.2 Pro (2012-01-16) ##
 * Fixed problem with rendering non ascii characters in backlog
 * Fixed broken backlog inline editing when using Trac 0.11.x
 
## 0.9.6.1 / 1.3.6.1 Pro (2012-01-15) ##
 * Fixed bug causing the backlog not load correctly when some fields contain single quotes

## 0.9.6 / 1.3.6 Pro (2012-01-12) ##
 * Performance improvement for backlog rendering
 * Fetch ticket list via xml-rpc. Currently the xml-rpc support is limited to read-only operations and deletion. Extended support like ticket creation, update and hierarchical information is planned for next versions. For this feature to work the Trac XML-RPC plugin (http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin) has to be installed
 * Fixed #1109: Cannot collapse filter in custom query
 * Fixed appliance bug: non alphabetic characters in project name cause authentication failure
 
## 0.9.5 / 1.3.5 Pro (2011-10-07) ##
 * Rename! Agilo for Scrum has been renamed to Agilo for trac
 * In keeping with the new name, we've also given the tool a visual makeover
 * The ability to allow cascading deletions has been added (see agilo-help/admin/LinkAdmin)

## 0.9.4 / 1.3.4 Pro (2011-06-15) ##
 * Fixed #1091: Backlogs would not display a list of team members if restrict_owner was enabled
 * Fixed #1103: Contingent GUI on Team page doesn't work
 * Removed option to disable Agilo's Advanced UI since disabling it would break Backlog and Whiteboard
 * Fixed dependency problem requiring simplejson also for python2.6+ (thanks to Ron Cole)
 * Totalling row displays number of tickets
 * Added an extended version of the http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/SqliteToPgScript with Agilo support
 * Documentation Fixes

## 0.9.3 / 1.3.3 Pro (2011-02-09) ##
 * Fixed #1905: Under certain circumstances tickets would lose their position in the backlog after changing an attribute on them.
 * Integrated community patches to support multiple repositories while still using the agilo commit hook functionality. Many thanks to Josh Moore from http://openmicroscopy.org for this.
 * Fixed handling of 0.5 Story points in Sprint commitment
 * Pro: Display configured alias in inline editor
 * Pro: Exit inline editor with escape key (now works in Safari as well)
 * Fixed #1487 link configuration changes are not persisted immediately

## 0.9.2 / 1.3.2 Pro (2010-12-14) ##
 * Pro: You can configure up to two additional 'In Progress' columns on the White board.
   Each column correlates to a defined ticket status. To activate those, make sure you
   have a workflow configured that leads from and to these statuses.
   Then you can activate these extra columns by changing your trac.ini like this:
   
   [agilo-whiteboard]
   second_whiteboard_in_progress_ticket_status = <status_name>
   second_whiteboard_in_progress_ticket_status.position = after
   third_whiteboard_in_progress_ticket_status = <another_status_name>
   third_whiteboard_in_progress_ticket_status.position = before
 * Fixed saving due and completed dates on milestones in Trac 0.12
 * Fixed highlighting of search results in the Backlog on Firefox
 * Fixed Sprins with non-ASCII characters on Python 2.4 and using PostgreSQL
 * Fixed directory listing in source browser
 * Fixed an issue with persistent filters that could lead to all items in the backlog being
   filtered out on load until you changed the filter.

## 0.9.1 (2010-10-25) ##
 * Agilo is now compatible with Trac 0.12. While we're pretty confident that all
   basic operations work, we'd like to see some more real-world testing before 
   we declare that feature as 'production ready'. Agilo with Trac 0.12 is 
   currently slower than Trac 0.11.
 * Pro: Agilo now remembers your filter settings in the backlog/whiteboard so
   if you switch to another page, you don't have to configure the filters again
 * Global backlogs now have an option to include 'planned' tickets
   (which have their sprint and/or milestone set).
 * Pro: Agilo now remembers if you looked at a sprint using the whiteboard or 
   the traditional sprint backlog and when you select a sprint in the left 
   navigation it'll directly use that view instead of always going to the 
   traditional sprint backlog.
 * Pro: Tasks created in the Whiteboard now also copy attributes from the 
   story/bug like on the backlog.
 * Agilo can now use wiki formatting in ticket fields. To configure that, 
   change this in the trac.ini/[ticket-custom]:
   my_field.format = wiki
   Please note that you need at least Trac 0.11.3
 * 'Show only my items' filter is disabled if user is not logged in

 * Pro: Fix bad error message in Whiteboard if user has not enough permissions
 * Fix display of favicon in Internet Explorer
 * Fix email address hiding in the ticket detail view (when the user has no 
   EMAIL_VIEW permission, only the local part of the email address will be 
   displayed)

## 0.9.0.7 (2010-08-16) ##

### Totals Row in the Backlog:
The backlog now contains a row at the end which displays totals for each 
numeric column. The totals ignore 'alternative fields' like the calculated 
field 'total remaining time' of User Stories.

 * Agilo is now compatible with Genshi 0.6
 * Fix Agilo Pro bug: Can not leave quick owner choose ui in Google Chrome
 * Fix Agilo Pro bug: SVN commits were not working unless a PATH was set explicitly
 * Fix Agilo Pro regression: Could not use Agilo Pro on older Trac versions


## 0.9.0.3 (2010-06-28) ##
 * Fix bug "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is unsubscriptable" when accessing the
   whiteboard or a sprint backlog


## 0.9.0.2 (2010-06-25) ##

### Bugfixes:
 * When you remove the sprint of a story, the story appears in the product 
   backlog again (the internal milestone field is reset)
 * Pro: Display the Sidebar on the Whiteboard
 * When using the pound sign (#) in a sprint or milestone name, the links
   on the Roadmap page were not displayed correctly
 * Fixed duplicate confirm commitment when the filtered burndown is enabled
 * Fixed wrong error message when viewing a global backlog that the user
   is not allowed to modify
 * Display Agilo Favicon instead of Trac's by default
 * Pro: Grey background when a ticket edit dialog opens works in all browsers


## 0.9.0.1 (2010-05-28) ##

### Fix Failing Update with Postgres and pre-0.7 Environments
If you created your Agilo environment with Agilo before 0.7 (October 2008 and
earlier), and you are using PostgreSQL, you may run into an issue during the DB
upgrade fom Agilo 0.8* to 0.9. This release enables a clean upgrade (even after
a previous upgrade failed).



## 0.9 (2010-05-27) ##

### High Resolution Historic Burndown: 
The burndown chart will now correctly document the increase or decrease of
remaining time throughout the sprint, even if you add or remove tickets in the
middle of the sprint. A higher data resolution now increases accuracy, so you
gain hourly data points for your burndown charts.

### Better Visibility for Sudden Changes in Burndown Chart
If you add or remove a story with its tasks from a sprint, the burndown chart
will now show a vertical rise or fall for the remaining time the tasks for that
story added or removed. This allows you to clearly distinguish from normal, but
steep, burndown and the extraordinary event of removing a story from a sprint.

### Show Only Working Days in Burndown
The burndown chart can now optionally hide weekends and other days with no
capacity, such as bank holidays.

You can enable it in the configuration file with the option
`burndown_should_show_working_days_only = True` in the section
`[agilo-general]`. This will hide all days without capacity from the burndown
chart. Please note however that this only works reliably if all team members are
in the same time zone. (The time zone can be set in each user's preferences,
accessible from the upper right toolbar of each logged in user).

### Enhanced Inline Editor (Pro)
The ticket inline editor allows you to edit all ticket fields in one dialog
directly in the Backlog. It now shows you what you are editing, including the
type of the ticket, has a new loading indicator allows resizing of text areas in
browsers that support this.

### Move Tasks with their Story 
If you change the sprint of a story, all its open tasks that have the same
sprint set will move with it. This is especially useful if you want to move
already broken down stories into, out of, or in between sprints.

### All Ticket Fields are Editable in the Backlog
All fields of all tickets are now editable (configuration option removed), even
custom fields and summary. When you click on the value you want to change, Agilo
will show an input field where you can enter the new value without going to a
different page. Clicking another field or pressing enter will immediately store
the change on the server. Hitting escape will cancel the edit.

### Filtered Hierarchical Backlog and Whiteboard
The Backlog and the Whiteboard (Pro) can be filtered by arbitrary ticket
properties. The property to filter by can be specified via the setting
`backlog_filter_attribute`. Both the Backlog and Whiteboard now respect the
hierarchy of tickets when filtering. For example, if you set
`backlog_filter_attribute = component` to enable filtering by components, all
parent tickets (stories, requirements) of something that is selected by that
filter will be shown - even if the parent doesn't have that component set.

### Hide Closed Tickets in the Backlog and the Whiteboard
The Backlog and the Whiteboard can now hide all tickets that are closed with a
single click. Of course this filter too respects the hierarchy of tickets.

### User Specific Tickets
The Backlog and the Whiteboard can now limit display to tickets the user is
involved in. Guess what? This also respects the ticket hierarchy.

### Linking Tickets to Multiple Parents
Sometimes you might want to link a story to multiple requirements or a task to
multiple stories to document what it helps to achieve. In the new version, Agilo
will actually display this ticket with each parent so you can easily see all
references to it.

The arrow marker in front of the ticket summary shows that multiple copies of
this item are being rendered. Editing any them will instantly update all others.

### Improved Contingents Handling in the Backlog
Some Scrum teams need to perform unplannable tasks during their sprints (like
supporting end users or fixing critical bugs). These teams can set aside some
time ("contingent") for these activities to limit the uncertainty. The
ScrumMaster can now create these contingents for the team per sprint using the
plus button in the bottom toolbar of the contingent view. The contingent view
can be reached via the battery icon in the Backlog toolbar.

During the sprint, each team member can add or remove time from the contingent
(for example if they accidentally added too much time to it).

### Confirm Commitment
In Scrum the team confirms the commitment to document what they think they can
achieve in the a sprint. Now you can do this directly from the Backlog toolbar.
We also added a new permission `AGILO_CONFIRM_COMMITMENT` to enable this, which
the ScrumMaster has by default.

### Background Updating of the Backlog 
When editing the Backlog, it will load any changes to the Backlog that happened
and update its display to show them. This means that all tickets added by
someone else will show up, as will any changes that happen to other tickets as a
consequence of editing one ticket (e.g. story removal).

### Bugfix: Custom Top Level Types in Backlog
The Backlog can now display custom top level types besides User Story,
Requirements and Bugs. However the type still needs to have a relation to a
child type (like task) to be shown.

### Backlog Strictness Changes:
You cannot configure the backlog to be strict (include only tickets scheduled in that scope) or non-strict (show all tickets) anymore. Instead all Backlogs with global scope (e.g. the Product Backlog) is now always strict and all other backlogs are now always non-strict.

This means that when you schedule a story for a milestone or sprint, it will not be shown anymore in the product backlog.

### Caveats

 * If you upgrade while a sprint is running, your burndown chart for this sprint
   might look wrong as Agilo doesn't know the exact time when the commitment was
   confirmed.
 * The sprint Backlog does not yet expose a GUI to download its content as a
   CSV-file. It is however still accessible. To download, append '?format=csv' to
   the backlog-url. (or &format=csv if there already is another ? in the url)
 * The Backlog does not yet show the status of tickets. You can however add the
   ticket-status column to the Backlog to see the status of tickets. As a Trac
   Admin go to Admin > Backlogs > Sprint Backlog and click 'Show' in the 'Status'
   column. All tickets also have two css classes ticketstatus-<status> and
   tickettype-<type>. To use them just add a custom-css file to your trac (for
   details see
   <http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracInterfaceCustomization#SiteAppearance>)
 * Please note that this release is not compatible to Trac 0.12 and Genshi 0.6.
   Please make sure you remove them prior to installing Agilo (or you will get
   error messages doing so :)



## 0.8.4.1 (2010-01-29) ##

###Configurable columns in the new backlog
Now you can configure the columns in every backlog to your hearts content. (And
we respect the columns that you configured for each backlog instead of showing
the default columns). To configure this yourself, go to Admin > Backlogs, then
choose your backlog and enable/ disable what you want. (Note, editable columns
are still hard-coded, and sorting rules are not yet supported)

###Small things and Bugfixes
 * Alternative Column-Content is supported, so you can render „Remaining Time“
   for Tasks and use the same column to render „Total Remaining Time“ for Stories.
 * Multiple parents now don’t break the new backlog and the whiteboard and are
   just appended to the first parent in the view.
 * Sprint names with certain characters ('/', '&') broke the new backlog -
   these are now fixed.  
 * You can now submit a select field in the new backlog using Enter (Firefox)



## 0.8.4 (2009-12-18) ##

 - Improved on the Beta Backlog. It is now the default backlog, the previous
   backlog is now in deprecation. It allows multi-level drag & drop ordering and
   inline editing of values. The backlog in Agilo Pro also features inline editing
   and inline adding of items to facilitate breakdown of items such as
   Requirements, Stories and Bugs.
 - Added a toolbar for the backlog to keep all buttons inside the view at all
   time.
 - Added a contingent view to the new backlog. Enable / disable it with the
   contingent button in the toolbar of the Sprint. Features inline editing of
   values.
 - Unified the look of the buttons across Agilo.
 - Added the option to filter the backlog and whiteboard. To enable it, add the
   following line to your trac.ini:
    [agilo-general]
    backlog_filter_attribute = <some attribute>



## 0.8.3.2 (2009-12-03) ##

## 0.8.3.1 (2009-11-30) ##

### New Backlog:

Added a Beta version of the new Backlog. It is completely generated via
Javascript from json data. Most notable it does drag and drop of
container tickets with their contained tickets which means that you can
drag a story and get all the tasks with it, or drag a requirement and
drag all the stories and their tasks with it.

You can enable it by adding the ``enable_beta_backlog`` option to the
section ``agilo-general`` in your trac.ini. Here's an example

	[agilo-general]
	enable_beta_backlog = true

#### What works:

* Real hierarchical display of tickets with their containers
* Drag and drop of tickets with contained items
* Inline editing of Remaining-Time and Sprints, Story Points, Business Value and Story Priority
* Showing the burndown chart

#### What doesn't work yet:

* Configuring what columns to show for a backlog, we basically have two
  sets of rows for now, one for the sprint backlog and one for all other
  backlogs
* Inline editing of Story Points, Bussiness Value and Story Priority use
  hardcoded values, i.e. they can't be customized

This is still work in progress and not everything works to our quality
standards. Never the less we would love to get feedback on it in this
early stage to know where we need to go.

### Backlog:

* Added a live filter to the backlog so you can easily look at just a subset of the items therein
* Fixed a bug where the number of open/ closed tickets for a sprint was
  counted wrong leading to a problem to retarget still open stories to a
  new sprint when closing the old one
* Fix for IE where it would continously poll the server for non existing
  files during drag and drop causing a major slowdown

### General changes:

* switched sidebar to load the recent changes instead of just the
  alphabetical first pages from the wiki page index (Thanks to Christopher
  Mürbe of cockpit4 GmbH for this contribution)
* Changed the Agilo startup to use multi-env mode to simplify adding new
  environments to that Agilo
* Documentation fixes for the virtual machine operations manual
* Fixed a bug where sometimes custom ticket fields would go missing and
  couldn't be saved
* Added a workaround for IE that would sometimes move either the toolbar
  at the top or the footer out of the browser window and make them unreachable
* Fixed renaming milestones to propagate the rename to all contained sprints
* Changed the commit hook parsing to allow # in arbitrary locations and
  give stricter error checking for commands
* Removed "Create a" in the commands-section of the sideboar to allow
  longer custom names not to create line-breaks
* Some minor UX touches such as rephrasing error messages.

### Whiteboard (Pro)

* Dragging tasks as a Scrum Master who is also a team member no longer
  steals the task from that team member
* Added links from containers to their detail pages in the whiteboard
* Better visualisation of the fact that the whiteboard is disabled
* Now showing an error message if a task is connected to multiple
  stories prevents rendering the whiteboard

### Backlog (Pro)

* Fixes for the inline editor to submit on enter in all browsers
* Creating child tickets inline always creates tasks if that child-type
  is available
* Fixed a bug where opening and closing an inline editor would not
  reactivate its opening button



## 0.8.3 (2009-09-25) ##

### New Pro features:
- You can now create (referenced) tickets right in the Backlog, no need to go to
  separate pages anymore
- Testing infrastructure has been upgraded to better maintain quality

### Pro Bug fixes:
- Whiteboard / Backlog switcher is rendered in front of the preferences window
- Safari: Opening the story drawer makes the story form jump around
- Inline edit: the 'add' icon is shown instead of 'edit' icon
- IE7 Backlog flickering on mouse movement
- 'License Expired' message now longer shows up for Virtual Machine users
- Fixed the mod_wsgi issues when creating tasks on the Whiteboard
- IE7 and IE8 now correctly display the loading spinner
- In IE8 you can now save your task in the Whiteboard task editor by hitting
  enter
- In IE7 task validation errors are shown in the correct layer
- The summary field is properly rendered in IE7

### Bug fixes:
- People with the role TEAM_MEMBER can now edit bugs they created
- The attachment creation link is shown for bugs
- Agilo will now show a warning if the trac is not compatible with the installed
  Python version (Ubuntu, Debian)



## 0.8.2.0.2 (2009-08-28) ##

bug fixes:
- Using Agilo with plain Trac UI is now tested in the functional test suite


## 0.8.0.1 (2010-08-09) ##

## 0.8 (2009-08-05) ##

new features:
- Custom search for Agilo help pages
- Backlogs can be exported in the CSV format
- burndown chart: show straight line for ideal burndown even if no capacity 
  information is available for a sprint (e.g. no team assigned to the sprint)
- timezone handling (requires trac 0.11.5): Burndown chart uses user's preferred
  timezone to display dates/sprint creation takes timezone into account.
- New config option to allow sprints to start/end on weekends:
    Set 'sprints_can_start_or_end_on_weekends' in [agilo-general] to True
  This is helpful for companies in countries where Saturday or Sunday is a 
  regular working day.

small improvements:
- better description for create/delete link buttons
- Firefox users get 'nice buttons' too
- Python 2.6 is now supported

bug fixes:
- Backlog indentation working again
- Closed #628: svn hook script clears remaining time if decimal numbers are used
- Closed #675: Ticket appears on top of the backlog after it was closed
- fixed broken link to sprint (from the timeline view)
- fixed switching between ideal days and ideal hours
- fixed total bar in the ticket statistics chart
- fixed link in the dashboard to update tickets by CSV import 
- added missing help pages for the Scrum glossary
- changed some code which might be the cause for the 'tickets loose their 
  sprint connection' issue that was reported by users previously. 
- Closed #705: Agilo interfers with plain trac projects when used in a 
               multi-environment setup
- prevent creation of contingents without name
- Sprint Ticket Stats chart must always start with 0 to make the graph 
  meaningful (thanks to Andrew Perella for the fix)
- Can set owner, reporter and status through CSV import


## 0.7.3 (2009-01-20) ##

new features:
- Charts are now generated client-side using Javascript (jQuery/Flot), therefore
  matplotlib, numpy and PIL are not needed any more.
- Sprints in pulldown menus are now grouped by planned, running and closed 
  sprints (like Trac does for milestones).
- Chart caching is now independent from the chart size less time to wait if the
  chart was rendered before
- Some team metrics are now shown in the same chart so that they are more 
  meaningful
- new documentation on how to manage Sprints in the Agilo User Guide

bug fixes:
- Closed #606: Proposals in autocomplete widget for linking other tickets do 
  not match user input
- Closed #641: Problems with multiple environments after the first query with 
  an Agilo-enabled project
- Fix problem when no pysqlite2 was installed ("cannot import name PyFormatCursor")


## Version 0.7 (Phoenix) ##

### 2008-10-05 by ANdreaT ###

Looks like we forgot to update the CHANGES file, I have to find a way to generate 
the CHANGES automatically using agilo :-?

### 2008-05-01 by ANdreaT ###

- Closed #102: The Timeline works again also with Ticket Changes
- Other UI fixes here and there

### 2008-04-18 by FSchwarz ###

- Closed #92: Try to detect the file encoding with chardet
- Some small ui fixes for the import template
- Increased the number of rows to display in the import view to 20

### 2008-04-17 by ANdreaT ###

- Closed #83 and #84. Closes #54 as well, the burndown chart now shows the today in the form of a "moving" vertical bar (moving by hours), and shows the number of remaining hours on the chart as well. The color of the box, is neutral if the actual burndown is "close" (set tolerance in trac.ini as burndown.tolerance, default=10%), is "red" if the actual is above the ideal for more than the tolerance, and "green" if it is below for more than the tolerance.
- Still #30:2h to go, I plan to write better messages for all the chart types in case of failure, and check again that they draw in any situation.
- Closed #39 and #40, now the ticket statistics shows also the total amount of tickets, and the number is in a colored box, which will be neutral if the number of ticket planned and closed will be equal, red in case there will be more planned than closed, and green otherwise. Leaving the requirement open, there will be more room to changes for sure.
- Refactored sorting by property, now follows the logical order in the trac.ini file.

### 2008-04-16 by ANdreaT ###

- Closed #96, now update of Sprint Backlog redirects to the "view" page so that the reload will not repost data (Good REST principle). Also fixed bug related to burndown update of "own" tasks as a team member.
- Closed #77, now the reports are simplified, and there is no more idea assigned to me. Still some work possible, but wait to see how to solve reporting problem in general in agilo 0.7 with trac 0.11.
- Closed #94 and #95. Closed #79 as well with a nice addition, now the outgoing links on the ticket preview pane are sortable. The links are sorted by summary, but the sort is stable, therefore it is allowed to specify a comma separated list of property to sort for, including calculated property. Added .sort to the links, for example:
		[agilo-links]
		allow = requirement-story, story-task, bug-task
		requirement.story.sort = story_priority:desc, story_points:desc	
Would sort the `stories` first by summary, than by story_priority using decrescent order, and than by story_points using decrescent order.

### 2008-04-15 by ANdreaT ###

- Closed #76 and still #77:2h, I will simplify the reports as much as possible there are too many specific dialects of SQL that risk to generate problems.

### 2008-04-14 by FSchwarz ###

- Closed #89: CSV import has now a preview page where the correct encoding can be selected

### 2008-04-10 by ANdreaT ###

- Closed #88 and #87, now when {{{restrict_owner = true}}} in trac.ini also the sprint backlog view shows pulldown menus for owner.
- Closed #86 and #85, now the hierarchy between tasks is dynamically calculated from the link configurations. The only limitation is that there should not be loop between types. Agilo calculates now the minimum spanning tree out of the graph of links and build out of it a hierarchy compressing to the lower levels the ticket types. Accordingly the Sprint Backlog view will show the items hierarchically. Still to improve the rendering is fixed on ticket types to display colors and styles, we should find a better way for this, probably a major redesign is needed :-)
- Fixed also a minor bug, related to the previous feature, now the "today" in the sprint backlog is marked "on-top" of every other ticket specific style.

### 2008-04-08 by ANdreaT ###

- Closed #68 and #74, both related to the possibility of moving a tasks to another milestone, either automatically or manually and having the remaining time reset accordingly into the new burndown as well.
- Closed #80 and #81, now clicking links from edit pane open the linked ticket also in edit pane, and the HR has been removed in case there is no possible link to create from the current ticket type.
- Closed #78 now link:hover on done tasks highlight to white instead of the same green as the background.
- Closed #20 now in the Scrum Dashboard is created a link for each of the existing types, should result in easier usability. This will need an upgrade, the template for the dashboard is generated upon install of the plugin. ALso fixed annoyance with PostgreSQL View Report not deleting during update and ending up in multiple copies.

- Improved Sprint Backlog view, now hides all closed tickets, not only the completed tasks anymore.
- Fixed some more minor issues with agilo-theme, now displaying correctly on all pages.

### 2008-03-31 by ANdreaT ###

- Closed bug #66 (With a work around)
- Improved Sprint Backlog view (closes #47) and added the following features:
 - A a team_member in case a task is not yet assigned, I can assign it to myself or some other resource in the team
 - In the Backlog view, I can edit the tasks for which I am owner, without the need to click into the task and go to the edit pane.
 - Now tickets which are closed are showed as grayed out. The tasks that are completed into the sprint are still marked as Done, in green.

### 2008-03-17 by ANdreaT ###

- Closed bugs #26 and #55
- improved some more the stylesheet view

### 2008-03-12 by ANdreaT ###

- Added subversion hooks for pre and post commit (Story #44), now agilo 
offers the possibility to close, and change the remaining time of the items
from the SVN comment. It is possible to submit command such as:

		This change closes #234 and remaining #235:8h  
That will close the ticket #234 and set remaining time for the #235 to 8h.

### 2008-03-10 by SSchulze ###

- Implemented the ability to define alias names for ticket types (#35)

### 2008-02-29 by ANdreaT ###

- Fixed Bugs relative to the agilo-theme (support: #9) as well as improved layout
- Added visualization for task in progress in the Sprint Backlog view, now tasks that are "assigned", when team_member accept them, are shown in orange. This helps the Scrum Master in visualizing rapidly the number of on going tasks, and if needed bring the team back in focus

### 2008-02-23 by ANdreaT ###

- Added more tests for the link cache, added parameter to disable cache in the config file, section [agilo-links]:
		
		[agilo-links]
		allow = ...
		cache.timeout = <num_milliseconds> 0 disables the cache
		cache.related = True|False enables or disable the cache of first level link of an endpoint
- Added option to configure which properties of a ticket should be shown on the link into the ticket:
		[agilo-links]
		allow = ...
		story.task.show = owner, remaining_time Shows the owner and remaining_time as options on the link to a task onto a story ticket.

- Fixed BUG related to the creation of new tickets, now they are as well typed and the changing of the type will result into a reload of the form to apply the new type.
- Fixed BUG related to the upgrade from a previous version of Agilo, in the agilo-sprint-data the milestone table was not updated completely, particularly the column duration was ignored, causing the loss of the duration data for the sprints. The data were and are anyway still available.

### 2008-02-14 by ANdreaT ###

- Added automatic task closing when the remaining time is set to 0. The task resolution is set to "fixed" and the status to "closed"
- WARNING: for compatibility reason the `user_story` type has been renamed as `story` also in the reports and views

### 2008-02-12 by SSchulze ###

- The default ticket types used by Agilo (story, task, bug) will now be automatically created by agilo-types.

### 2008-02-12 by ANdreaT ###

- Added Charts for Sprint Statistics, now available for Tickets statistics and Resources statistics. The first one is showing the amount of ticket planned, against the amount of ticket closed per sprint, grouped by type. The second one is giving a view over the current team commitment, assigning a percentage of load to all the Sprint resources. It is useful to check if someone tends to commits too much and someone too few and helps the team in keeping balanced the load.
- Added AgiloChartMacro as a Wiki Macro to embed into the wiki every chart available in agilo-charts. To use the Macro:
	
		[[AgiloChart(type, sprint[,widthxheight])]]  
for the Burndown Chart call it as: [[AgiloChart(burndown, "My Sprint Name", 680x250)]]

### 2008-02-11 by SSchulze ###

- Added MySQL compliant SQL scripts (agilo-scrumdashbord).

### 2008-01-23 by ANdreaT ###

- Fixed problems with SQLite, added separate set of queries without typed data
- Started adding default configuration parameters for plugins, now the first time the plugins are installed, they set in the trac.ini file a default set of properties. This is easing the configuration and setup process
- Started renaming of packages to avoid name clashing, packages names as well as entries where too much generic. The same renaming will affect also the "urls" configured and the trac.ini sessions

### 2008-01-12 by ANdreaT ###

- Improved handling of calculated properties and ticket updates.

### 2008-01-06 by ANdreaT ###

- Added Script (create_roles.py) to configure initial set of roles and actions to start using the tool. Remember that the script is not intrusive, it is neither removing existing actions/rights nor checking if they are already existing, therefore you may see some errors in the console for already existing ACLs, just ignore them.
- Added option to build script (build_eggs.py) to create source based distributions and include the scripts in the root directory, as well as any UPPER_CASE file (CHANGES, README...)

### 2008-01-05 by ANdreaT ###

- Added Control to Scrum Dashboard to visualize in the main manu as "Scrum" only if the connected user has at least the 'TICKET_VIEW' right. In this way the behavior is aligned to the other Trac Modules.
