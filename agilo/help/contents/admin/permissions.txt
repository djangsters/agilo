= Permissions and Privileges in Agilo =
[[PageOutline]]

Agilo follows the Permission Approach of Trac and extends it with specific meta
permissions that entail all the default actions for a specific Role, like for
example: SCRUM_MASTER, PRODUCT_OWNER, TEAM_MEMBER.

You can build your own roles as ''Subject'' assigning all the permission you 
like and than assign real users to these ''Subject'' making them part of a 
''Group''. To do so, you can either use the 
[agilo-help:admin/CommandLine command line tool] or the Web Admin interface in 
case you have installed the 
[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AccountManagerPlugin AccountManager] plug-in, default
on [http://www.agilofortrac.com/support-services/ Agilo hosted servers] and on the 
virtual appliance.


== Custom Types ==

Agilo allows you to create ''custom'' [agilo-help:admin/TypeAdmin ticket types], and supports you generating the permissions needed to create these types. For example if you create a custom ticket type like 'spike', a new permission 'CREATE_SPIKE' (type name is upper-cased) is added to Trac's permission system. By default only TRAC_ADMIN and TICKET_ADMIN can create tickets with the new type. However, you can give the CREATE_SPIKE permission to any user you like (e.g. if you add the permission to the 'authenticated' group, all authenticated users can create spikes).

Agilo does not enforce any special policies on ticket editing for custom types.

That means everyone with the 'TICKET_MODIFY' permission can edit your custom ticket type. If you like to have additional restrictions for custom types, you need to create a custom [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracDev/ApiChanges/0.11#IPermissionPolicy IPermissionPolicy] like we did with `agilo.utils.AgiloPolicy`.
