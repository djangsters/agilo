[[PageOutline]]

Agilo is a '''simple''' and easy to use '''web-based''' tool to support teams working with [http://www.scrumalliance.org Scrum]. Agilo supports all the '''Roles''' and main '''Ceremonies''' of the Scrum framework and allows the roles to share and interact effectively with a minimum effort.

Agilo provides the management of '''Backlogs''' (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog by default, but teams can create other custom backlogs e.g. Bug Backlog) which are highly configurable and adaptable to every team's needs. Agilo provides some standard charts that can be embedded in Wiki pages and also shown in the '''Sprint Backlog''', such as the '''Burndown Chart'''.

Agilo allows you to define '''Milestones''' for Product Releases, and then split every milestone into one or more '''Sprints''', so that you can have an aggregated view of your project planning, as well as dig down into the details of each '''Sprint'''.

Agilo is based on [http://trac.edgewall.org Trac], a very popular ticket tracking system. You can find more information on '''Trac''' on the TracGuide.
