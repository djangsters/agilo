[[PageOutline]]

This short introduction will help you to set up and use Agilo. If you are using 
an [http://www.agilofortrac.com/support-services/ Agilo for trac] hosted project or the Agilo 
appliance, the [http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AccountManagerPlugin AccountManager]
plugin is already installed and configured to work with Agilo.

== Set up Agilo ==
Like in a good Scrum, you need a Team before starting. Agilo allows you to set up 
Teams and Team Members. In Agilo, a Team is composed of all the cross-functional 
members that will take part in a Sprint. 

=== Create a Team ===

	1. As an administrator (a user with TRAC_ADMIN rights) click on the Admin icon
	 [[Image(/chrome/agilo/images/icon.admin.png, border=0, width=16, height=16)]] 
	 in the toolbar, and go to the '''Agilo/Teams'''
	2. Enter the Team name in the textbox and push the '''Add''' button. You can 
	add a description for the team.
	3. To add a team member (remember the name will also be the username for 
	logging into the system), push the '''Add''' button. 
	4. In case the username is not existing yet, you will be asked if you wish to 
	create a new user, answer yes, or cancel to go back and retype an already 
	existing username (this requires to have the 
	[http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AccountManagerPlugin AccountManager] plugin) 
    5. You can enter now details about the user, including his/her default capacity per weekday (by default is calculated in 6 ideal hours per working day). Push the '''Add''' button and the user will be created and add to the Team. You can 	add as many user as you want.

=== Create a Product Owner ===

Every Product needs a Product Owner. Agilo has a defined role with special access 
rights for the Product Owner.
	1. As an administrator (a user with TRAC_ADMIN rights) click on the '''Admin icon'''
	 [[Image(/chrome/agilo/images/icon.admin.png, border=0, width=16, height=16)]] in 
	 the toolbar, and go to the '''Accounts/Users''' menu (this requires to have the
	  [http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AccountManagerPlugin AccountManager] plugin) and 
	  create the new user.
	2. To set username and password please go to '''General/Permissions''' and in 
	the form '''Grant Permission''' type as subject the username you just created, that should be the Product Owner. 
	3. In the Action pulldown menu, choose the PRODUCT_OWNER action, than press the
	 '''Add''' button


=== Create a Scrum Master ===

Every team needs a Scrum Master. Agilo has a defined Role with special access 
rights for the Scrum Master.

	1. As an administrator (a user with TRAC_ADMIN rights) click on the '''Admin 
	icon''' [[Image(/chrome/agilo/images/icon.admin.png, border=0, width=16, height=16)]]
	 in the toolbar, and go to the '''Accounts/Users''' menu (this requires that you  
	 have the [http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AccountManagerPlugin AccountManager] 
	 plugin) and you create the new user.
	2. To set username and password please go to '''General/Permissions''' and 
	in the form '''Grant Permission''' type as subject the username you just
	 created, that should be a Scrum Master.
	3. In the Action pulldown menu, choose the SCRUM_MASTER action, than press 
	the '''Add''' button.

=== Create a Milestone for a Release ===
In Agilo you can use milestones to represent releases. A release is a concept 
that normally spans through multiple sprints. It is the real release cycle that 
is planned also in terms of shipment of the product to the market/customer. 

	1. As a Product Owner you can create a Milestone, or rename an existing one 
	by clicking the '''Roadmap''' 
	[[Image(/chrome/agilo/images/icon.roadmap.png, border=0, width=16, height=16)]]
	button on the toolbar.
	2. Click on an existing milestone, and chose '''Edit Milestone''' in the 
	milestone edit form. You can change the name of the milestone, set a due 
	date and add a description
	3. When finished push the '''Submit Changes button'''

=== Create a Sprint ===
In Agilo you can create as many sprints you want in the context of a release, 
and set for each sprint the Start Date and, the End Date or Duration. It is a 
good practice to lay down from the beginning a set of Sprints for a new Product 
Release, so one can already match the path to the final release date. 

	1. As Product Owner you can create a Sprint by clicking the '''Roadmap''' 
	[[Image(/chrome/agilo/images/icon.roadmap.png, border=0, width=16, height=16)]] 
	button at the toolbar.
	2. Choose the milestone for which you want to create a Sprint.
	3. Locate the '''Add new Sprint''' button for that milestone and push it.
	4. Enter the name for the sprint. You can use the description to write clearly
	 the sprint goal at the Sprint Planning Meeting
	5. Enter start date and end date, or duration.
	6. Select the Team from the pulldown menu. (Without a team assigned, you will
	 not be able to properly plan a Sprint)
	7. Push the '''Submit Changes''' button
