The '''Burndown Chart''' is a chart showing the cumulative amount of hours - or [agilo-help:scrum/userstorypoints User Story Points] left to successfully complete the committed work for a [agilo-help:scrum/sprint Sprint]. This line is called the 'actual burndown'. 

Another important line is the 'ideal burndown' which shows the ideal way of getting work done: Starting from the commitment on the first day the ideal burndown decreases linearly until it hits the x axis on the last day of the sprint which represents a steady pace in development. Agilo features a quite sophisticated ideal burndown which is not just straight line but decrease proportional to the team's capacity on that day.

The Agilo Sprint Burndown Chart shows also two additional lines:
 - '''Capacity Line''': measures the real capacity per day of the [agilo-help:scrum/team Team] which is calculated by summing up the [agilo-help:user/preferences individual capacity] settings of each [agilo-help:scrum/teammember Team Member].
 - '''Trend Line''': shows the ''moving average'' calculated on the last three days of burndown, showing where the deliverable will probably end if the team continues to burndown with the current trend.
