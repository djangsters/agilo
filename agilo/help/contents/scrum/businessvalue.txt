The '''Business Value''' has been introduced as the 5th variable in Agile Project 
Management as an objective way to measure customer satisfaction. The '''Business 
Value''' measures the perceived ''value'' of a specific need from the 
''Customer/User'' point of view.

The '''Business Value''' is a ''number'' that can either be expressed in 
''absolute'' units or in ''relative'' units. Absolute units are normally currency 
such as $ or € or £, relative units are measuring the "relative" proportion of 
value between the considered set of [agilo-help:scrum/Requirement Requirements].

In Agilo the '''Business Value''' is represented by ''Business Value Points'' 
which are a non linear collection of numbers: 100, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1200, 2000, 
3000. These numbers are assigned using the
