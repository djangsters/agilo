It is one of the three main Scrum Ceremonies (together with 
[agilo-help:scrum/SprintPlanningMeeting Sprint Planning Meeting] and 
[agilo-help:scrum/SprintReviewMeeting Sprint Review Meeting]. It is a time-boxed 
(between 15 and 20 min.) meeting in which every 
[agilo-help:scrum/TeamMember Team Member] report to the rest of the Team 
answering the following three questions:

 - What have you done since yesterday?
 - What are you going to do today?
 - Are there any impediments in your way?

These three questions are normally asked by the [agilo-help:scrum/ScrumMaster Scrum Master],
helping the team in being effective and synchronized.


Agilo has to support this meeting, allowing the team to effectively analyze and 
manage the [agilo-help:scrum/SprintBacklog Sprint Backlog] and  
[agilo-help:scrum/BurndownChart Burndown Chart]. Normally, during the meeting the 
[agilo-help:scrum/ScrumMaster Scrum Master] takes care of updating the 
[agilo-help:scrum/Task Tasks] according to [agilo-help:scrum/TeamMember Team Member]
reports, and at the end of the meeting a new 
[agilo-help:scrum/BurndownChart Burndown Chart] is generated for the team.
