= Requirement =
[[PageOutline]]

In Agilo a '''Requirement''' represents the description of a ''need'', it belongs 
to the ''Problem Domain''. Requirements should answer the questions: 

 - '''WHAT?''' is the need or the problem to solve
 - '''WHY?''' is it a problem or necessary to be solved

A Requirement should be at the right level of granularity to allow a ''Stakeholder'' 
to assign to it a '''[agilo-help:scrum/BusinessValue Business Value]'''. 
Requirements have to be a clear ''problem statement'' if possible, written in a 
SMART (Simple, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Traceable) way.

Requirements in Agilo are linked to one or more '''
[agilo-help:scrum/UserStory User Story]''', which represent the ''functional'' 
solution to the Requirement problem.

To get more information about the user interface for requirements in Agilo, see 
[agilo-help:user/Ticket Agilo Ticket].
