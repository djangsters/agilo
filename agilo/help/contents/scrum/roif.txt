[[PageOutline]]

The '''Return on Investment Factor''' (ROIF) how measures how much 
value you gain by having a [agilo-help:/scrum/requirement Requirement] 
weighted against the complexity ([agilo-help:/scrum/UserStoryPoints User Story Points])
of implementing it.

In the default installation, the ROIF is calculated as 
[agilo-help:/scrum/BusinessValue Business Value] divided by the sum of the
mandatory User Story Points. Of course you can 
[agilo-help:/admin/TypeAdmin#CalculatedProperties change the calculation criteria]
of this property to include all User Stories (not just the mandatory ones).

A high ROIF value basically means that either it is a really valuable feature
or something is really easy to implement.
