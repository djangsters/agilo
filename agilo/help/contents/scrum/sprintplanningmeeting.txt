The '''Sprint Planning Meeting''' is one of the main three Scrum Ceremonies 
([agilo-help:scrum/DailyScrum Daily Scrum] and 
[agilo-help:scrum/SprintReviewMeeting Sprint Review Meeting] is another) 
and starts one [agilo-help:scrum/Sprint Sprint].

The [agilo-help:scrum/ProductOwner Product Owner] invites the Team to present 
them the [agilo-help:scrum/ProductBacklog Product Backlog] and asks them to 
commit to as much as they think they can successfully implement, test, document 
and integrate within the next Sprint.

Agilo supports this meeting too, at the moment it allows the Product Owner to 
present the feature, using the Product Backlog and digging down to each 
[agilo-help:scrum/Requirement Requirement] and [agilo-help:scrum/UserStory User Story].
The Product Owner can also set the 
[agilo-help:scrum/UserStoryPoints User Story Points] for each story once the 
Team estimated them.
