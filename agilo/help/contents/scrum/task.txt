[[PageOutline]]

A '''Task''' represent a ''single unit of work'' that can be completed by a 
[agilo-help:scrum/TeamMember Team Member]. The '''Task''' in Scrum is usually well 
detailed and fine grained, it is a good practice to keep tasks very easy to 
understand and descriptive enough so that whatever [agilo-help:scrum/TeamMember Team Member]
will pick it up and commit to complete it, will feel comfortable 
enough in determining when it is '''Done'''.

'''Task''' are estimated either in [agilo-help:scrum/IdealHour Ideal Hours] or
[agilo-help:scrum/IdealHour#idealday Ideal Days]. As a rule of thumb completing 
a task should take between 3 to 12 ideal hours of work (1/2 day up to two days).
