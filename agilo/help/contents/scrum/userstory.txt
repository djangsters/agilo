A '''User Story''' (in Agilo identified by the {{{story}}}) represent a possible 
''functional'' solution to a [agilo-help:scrum/Requirement Requirement]. 
A '''User Story''' models the ''Solution Domain'' for a Requirement describing 
the '''HOW''' a specific type of ''User'' of a ''system'' or ''subsystem'' could 
eventually solve the problem or fulfill the specific described need.

A '''User Story''' is a simple sentence in the form:

''As a {{{type_of_user}}} I would like to have (or I want) {{{some_capability}}} 
so that {{{business_value}}}''

The idea to keep stories simple is to make sure they are self contained, small 
and easy enough to design, code, document, test and integrate into one single 
iteration. In order to define which stories are more important or needed than 
others, in Agilo there are {{{story_priority}}} defined, so that each story can be:

 - '''Mandatory''': by definition will be needed in order to fulfill the associated 
 Requirement (be very strict when defining this type of story)
 - '''Linear''': increase linearly the value of the product, are like optional, 
 the more you have the better it is
 - '''Exciter''': very dangerous one, may increase exponentially the acceptance 
 of the product from the customer, they are normally entailing features of the 
 product that the ''User'' will not know to need until she will see it!

A '''User Story''' should also contain '''Acceptance Criteria''' as a part of 
its description so the team know what things they should test more extensively.

Agilo, see [agilo-help:user/Ticket Agilo Ticket].
