'''User Story Points''' represent a way to estimate User Stories, based on the principle of relative estimations, the most common sequence used by teams is:

0 1 2 3 5 8 13 20 40 100

Which is a pseudo-Fibonacci non linear sequence. Some teams also add the 1/2 point and a coffee cup to use when a break is needed.
